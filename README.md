Document Development:

The vending machine is made as the final test to program for the end of the first semester, as well to kickstart the new second semester of Programming Fundamentals.

The vending machin includes three categories of the main menu, such as snacks, drinks, and incenses. All three categories have four products. The snacks are the Kayode chocosticks, Dangopon dumplings, the bulbasmatki (or potato) chips, and a Meal Ready-to-Eat pizza. The drinks include paraqua water, edokaze soft drink, molokov milk, and a wintermelon boba tea. And the odd part, the incenses are angel vanilla, earth mint, moon cardamom, and a spring catnip.

Since this is my first flow chart, I can't say that if I made it right or not, but that is the best way of the vending machine I made works. It all starts with adding 10 creds in it, and the systems goes start until E.

There are so many code to use for the vending machine, tho these are the ones I used to sort the menu of each categories. I used dictionary that creates a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by comma. The def keyword used to define a function which is placed before a function name that is provided by the user to create a user-defined function. The strings is known for the format '()' braces for selecting the input of said category. The float item is known for representing numbers and their decimal points for the prices part of the program. The if, elif, and else are used for choices that of the main and alternative choices. And the function is for a block of statements that return to a specific task. These are the programming techniques I used for the vending machine to function for the program.

Programming fundamentals is so challenging. Lots and lots of coding since I had my time in computer subjects from the elementary schools. This is so much to take honestly, but the vending machine is the prime starting point to make a machine in coding. The prices should be working in terms of cost, the coding should be in a simplier process, and I need a lot learning to improve my coding. Overall it is still one of the most important subjects to deal with in the future for our business, so I should be needing to learn more of it in a simplier way to make improvements.

Appendix 1: Starting the vending machine with creds up to 10
Appendix 2: Choosing one of the categories of the menu (snacks, drinks, and incenses)
Appendix 3: Selecting the product in the chosen category
Appendix 4: Have as many products as possible until to press E to confirm selection
Appendix 5: Showing how many products is brought and returning the change before starting all over again
